## The Swiss Tax System

### Three-Tier Structure

Switzerland operates a decentralized tax system with taxes levied at three levels:

1. **Federal Level**: Uniform rates across all of Switzerland (max 11.5%)
2. **Cantonal Level**: Each of the 26 cantons sets its own tax laws and rates
3. **Municipal Level**: Over 2,000 municipalities apply multipliers to cantonal taxes

**How it works:**

- Municipalities follow cantonal tax law but set their own multiplier (Steuerfuss)
- Total tax = Federal tax + (Cantonal base tax × Municipal multiplier)
- The combined burden ranges from approximately 21% to 46%

### Tax Residency

You are tax resident in Switzerland if you:

- Have a permanent residence permit and live in Switzerland
- Stay in Switzerland for at least 30 days (if working) or 90 days (if not working)
- Are domiciled in Switzerland

## Federal Tax Brackets

### Federal Tax Rates 2025

The federal tax system is **progressive** with rates applied to income brackets based on **Article 36 DBG** (Federal Direct Tax Law).

**Source**: Form 58c - Swiss Federal Tax Administration (ESTV), valid from January 1, 2025

#### Single Taxpayers (Article 36 Abs. 1 DBG)

**Tax-Free Threshold**: Income below **CHF 15,200** is exempt from federal tax.

**Tax Collection Threshold**: Tax collection starts at **CHF 18,500** (minimum CHF 25).

**Progressive Tax Structure** (example brackets from official tariff):

| Taxable Income (CHF) | Federal Tax (CHF) | Marginal Rate on Next CHF 100            |
| -------------------- | ----------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| 0 - 15,000           | 0.00              | 0% (exempt)                              |
| 15,000 - 32,800      | 0.00 - 137.05     | 0.77% per CHF 100                        |
| 32,800 - 42,900      | 137.05 - 225.90   | 0.88% per CHF 100                        |
| 42,900 - 57,200      | 225.90 - 603.40   | 2.64% per CHF 100                        |
| 57,200+              | 603.40+           | 2.97% then increasing                    |
| 793,400+             | ~**81,000** | **11.5%** (maximum effective rate) |

**Maximum Federal Tax Rate**: **11.5%** reached at taxable income of **CHF 793,400**

**Note**: The exact tax amount is calculated using the official ESTV tariff table (Form 58c), which provides precise tax amounts for every income level. The table uses marginal rates that increase progressively.

#### Married Couples / Registered Partnerships (Article 36 Abs. 2 DBG)

**Tax-Free Threshold**: Income below **CHF 29,700** is exempt from federal tax.

**Tax Collection Threshold**: Tax collection starts at **CHF 32,200** (minimum CHF 25).

Married couples benefit from **income splitting** (Splittingverfahren):

- Combined income is divided by 2
- Tax rate is applied to 50% of combined income
- Result is doubled to get total tax
- This significantly reduces tax burden, especially in middle-income brackets

**Maximum Federal Tax Rate**: **11.5%** reached at total taxable income of **CHF 940,900**

**Progressive Tax Structure for Married Couples** (example brackets):

| Combined Taxable Income (CHF) | Approximate Federal Tax (CHF) | Notes                        |
| ----------------------------- | ----------------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| 0 - 29,700                    | 0                             | Exempt                       |
| 32,200 - 53,500               | ~25 - 200                     | Low rates (1.0% marginal)    |
| 53,500 - 79,100               | ~200 - 700                    | Progressive                  |
| 940,900+                      | ~**108,000**            | **11.5%** maximum rate |

#### Parent/Family Tariff (Article 36 Abs. 2bis DBG)

For single parents, widowed, separated, or divorced taxpayers living with children or dependent persons:

- **Child tax credit**: **CHF 263** reduction per child (deducted from calculated tax amount)
- Applies to both federal direct tax calculations

#### Federal Tax Deductions

| Deduction                              | Amount (2025)                      |

## Municipal Taxes

### How Municipal Tax Multipliers Work

Each municipality sets a **tax multiplier** (Steuerfuss/Taux d'imposition) applied to the cantonal base tax:

**Formula:**

```
Municipal Tax = Cantonal Base Tax × Municipal Multiplier
Total Cantonal + Municipal Tax = Cantonal Base Tax × (1 + Municipal Multiplier)
```

**Example (Zurich):**

- Municipal multiplier: 119% (or factor of 1.19)
- If cantonal base tax = CHF 10,000
- Municipal tax = CHF 10,000 × 1.19 = CHF 11,900
- Total cantonal + municipal = CHF 21,900

### Major Cities - Municipal Tax Multipliers (2025)

| City                 | Canton      | Municipal Multiplier | Notes                      |

| **Zurich**     | Zurich      | 119% (1.19)          |                            |
| **Geneva**     | Geneva      | Varies by commune    | Each commune sets own rate |
| **Basel**      | Basel-Stadt | Varies (3 communes)  |                            |
| **Bern**       | Bern        | ~154%                | Higher multiplier          |
| **Lausanne**   | Vaud        | ~158%                |                            |
| **Lucerne**    | Lucerne     | ~110%                |                            |
| **St. Gallen** | St. Gallen  | ~120%                |                            |
| **Lugano**     | Ticino      | ~100%                |                            |

**Within cantons**, municipal multipliers can vary significantly:

- **Zurich canton**: Multipliers range from 0.72 to 1.30

## Real Estate & Property Tax

### Imputed Rental Value (Eigenmietwert)

**MAJOR REFORM - September 2025**

On **September 28, 2025**, Swiss citizens voted (57.7% in favor) to **abolish the imputed rental value system**.

#### Current System (Until ~2028)

**What is Eigenmietwert?**

- Homeowners must declare **notional rental income** for owner-occupied property
- Calculated as **60-70% of market rent**
- Added to taxable income

**In return, you can deduct:**

- ✅ Mortgage interest (actual costs)
- ✅ Maintenance and renovation costs
- ✅ Energy efficiency improvements

#### New System (Expected January 1, 2028)

**What changes:**

- ❌ **No more** imputed rental value taxation
- ❌ **No more** general mortgage interest deductions
- ❌ **No more** maintenance/renovation deductions

**Exceptions:**

- ✅ Rental properties: Still can deduct mortgage interest and costs
- ✅ First-time buyers: Transitional mortgage interest deduction
  - CHF 10,000/year for married couples (CHF 5,000 singles)
  - Decreases by 10% annually over 10 years
  - Example: Year 1: CHF 10,000, Year 2: CHF 9,000, ..., Year 10: CHF 1,000

**Timeline:**

- Federal law passed: September 2025
- Cantons have ~2 years to adapt legislation
- Expected implementation: **January 1, 2028**

### Current Deductions (Until Reform)

| Deduction Type              | Details                                                |
| --------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Mortgage interest** | Fully deductible (actual costs)                        |
| **Maintenance costs** | Actual costs OR flat-rate (10-20% of rental value)     |
| **Renovations**       | Deductible if value-maintaining (not value-increasing) |
| **Energy efficiency** | Enhanced deductions for green improvements             |

### Property Taxes

**Real estate gains tax** (cantonal):

- Applies when selling property
- Varies by canton (0-40% depending on holding period)
- Longer holding period = lower rate
